# snes-fighter
A homebrew two player fighting game for the SNES themed around my family

The vision for this game is to be like a knock-off Street Fighter with my family
members as the selectable characters.
The hope is that it will be a fun game to play during family get togethers
when the SNES classic is brought out.

This entire idea and game itself is very *very* crude and in the early stages.
I'm not sure about the practicality of it, but I think it can be done in C
without a large loss of speed.

This game uses the [pvsneslib](https://github.com/alekmaul/pvsneslib)
suite which is a C compiler and toolchain for developing games on the SNES in a higher level than assembly.
The library is quite finnicky to get set up.
